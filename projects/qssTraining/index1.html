            <p>The biggest revolution in the history of communication is Social Media and this
                 started a completely new era altogether. Every platform that enables us to 
                 communicate and socialize locally and globally is a Social media platform.
                 Facebook, Twitter, Youtube, Instagram and Whatsapp are its many avatars.</p>
            <h2>Benefits :</h2> 
            <p>
                Social media allows us to fellowship with people from all corners of the world. 
                It gives us a sense of a global community where we are no more divided by
                 political powers but united by our thoughts and interests. We can always
                  keep in touch with people from
                 all walks of our life â€“ a boon that seemed impossible until social media showed up.
            </p> 
            <p>
                It gives the common man a platform to voice with complete freedom of expression,
                 be it for supporting a cause or for addressing a national or international 
                 issue of any sensitivity. Business prospects and job opportunities gear
                 up as social media is a stage with global audience to showcase our talents.
            </p>
            <h2>
                Drawbacks :
            </h2>
            <p>
                The biggest drawback of Social media is that it is highly addictive to
                 almost every person using it. It has altered our sense of reality such 
                 that in priding the global connectivity it offers, we forget to connect
                  with the people around us and grow emotionally distant. This obsession of
                   being glued to our gadget screens all day brings with it an array of health 
                disorders and is the main cause of stress, depression, anxiety and sleeplessness.
            </p>
            <h2>Conclusion :</h2>
            <p>
                Social Media has expanded the horizons of communication more than ever 
                and has changed the pace of life forever. While eliminating Social 
                media from our lives is out of question, its usage can be moderated
                 by limiting our time on it.
